# Product Context - Operation Rising Lion

## Why This Project Exists

### Purpose
Operation Rising Lion serves as an interactive arcade experience that combines classic gaming mechanics with a specific thematic narrative. The game addresses the desire for:
- **Nostalgic gameplay**: Reviving the beloved Worms-style trajectory-based combat
- **Narrative simulation**: Providing an interactive way to explore geopolitical scenarios
- **Technical achievement**: Demonstrating advanced web-based game development

### Problems It Solves
1. **Entertainment gap**: Limited browser-based arcade strategy games available
2. **Educational simulation**: Interactive way to understand military conflict dynamics
3. **Technical demonstration**: Showcase of modern web technologies without external dependencies
4. **Character integration challenge**: Seamlessly incorporating real-world figures into game mechanics

## How It Should Work

### Core Experience Flow
```
Game Start → Target Selection → Weapon Choice → Aiming → Firing → Impact Assessment → Victory/Defeat
```

### Player Journey
1. **Initial engagement**: Player sees flags and understands the scenario immediately
2. **Learning phase**: Discovers weapon types and their unique characteristics
3. **Skill development**: Masters trajectory calculations and timing
4. **Challenge escalation**: Faces increasingly difficult defensive countermeasures
5. **Achievement satisfaction**: Successfully destroys targets with spectacular effects

### Key Interactions
- **Aiming system**: Intuitive mouse-based trajectory control with visual feedback
- **Weapon selection**: Clear inventory management with strategic resource allocation
- **Defense response**: Dynamic AI reactions that create tension and unpredictability
- **Visual feedback**: Immediate and satisfying explosion effects with proper scale

## User Experience Goals

### Immediate Objectives
- **Instant comprehension**: Player understands the game within 5 seconds
