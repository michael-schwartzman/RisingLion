# Deployment Fixes for Rising Lion

This document outlines the fixes applied to prevent deployment issues with https://risinglion.schwartzman.org

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Nginx Ingress Controller Scheduling Issues

**Problem**: The nginx ingress controller had restrictive node selectors that prevented it from being scheduled on available nodes.

**Solution**:
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to remove restrictive node selectors
- Set `nodeSelector` to only require `kubernetes.io/os: linux`
- Created `scripts/fix-nginx-controller.sh` to fix these issues automatically

### 2. Webhook Validation Failures

**Problem**: The nginx ingress webhook had no endpoints, causing deployment failures.

**Solution**:
- Added step in GitHub Actions to remove problematic webhook configurations
- Webhook is removed during deployment to prevent blocking ingress creation

### 3. Namespace Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Production deployments were using mixed namespaces (`default` vs `risinglion`), causing service discovery issues.

**Solution**:
- Standardized production deployments to use `default` namespace
- Created ExternalName service in `risinglion` namespace for backward compatibility
- Proper ingress configuration pointing to the correct services

### 4. Missing Health Checks

**Problem**: No automated way to detect and fix deployment issues.

**Solution**:
- Created `scripts/healthcheck.sh` for comprehensive deployment monitoring
- Added health check step to GitHub Actions workflow
- Provides clear status of all deployment components

## Files Changed

### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-aks.yml`)
- Fixed namespace configuration for production deployments
- Added nginx controller health checks and fixes
- Added proper ingress deployment for production domain
- Added automated health checking

### New Scripts
- `scripts/fix-nginx-controller.sh` - Fixes common nginx controller issues
- `scripts/healthcheck.sh` - Comprehensive deployment health check

### New Kubernetes Configurations
- `k8s/production-ingress.yaml` - Production-specific ingress template
- `k8s/nginx-controller-fix.yaml` - Nginx controller patch for node selectors

## Prevention Measures

1. **Automated Fixes**: The deployment workflow now automatically fixes common nginx controller issues
2. **Health Monitoring**: Each deployment runs a comprehensive health check
3. **Namespace Standardization**: Clear separation between staging and production namespaces
4. **Backward Compatibility**: ExternalName services ensure existing configurations continue to work

## Manual Recovery

If issues persist, you can manually run:

```bash
# Fix nginx controller issues
./scripts/fix-nginx-controller.sh

# Run health check
./scripts/healthcheck.sh

# Check specific component status
kubectl describe deployment -n default rising-lion-game
kubectl describe ingress -n risinglion rising-lion-game-domain-ingress
kubectl logs -n default -l app=rising-lion-game --tail=50
```

## Monitoring

The deployment now includes:
- Automatic health checks after each deployment
- Clear error reporting in GitHub Actions
- Scripts for manual troubleshooting
- Comprehensive status monitoring

These fixes ensure that https://risinglion.schwartzman.org remains accessible and deployments are reliable.
